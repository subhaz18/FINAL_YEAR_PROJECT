CONFERENCE PAPER - FULL MARK
CUSTOMIZED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK MODEL FOR IOT BOTNET ATTACK DETECTION





















INTRODUCING REINFORCEMENT WITH CNN(NOVELTY):
1. Detecting the botnet attacks using CNN Model
2. continuously trying to adapt the cnn model based on the feedback using RL(benefits: dynamically adapt to parameters and strategies to improve accuracy)
3. optimization of decision by choosing which feature as more importance(benefit: model's effectiveness)
4. giving +v reward for each positive reinforcement/detection and -v reward for each negative reinforcement/detection(benefit: learns and refines the detection mechanism)
5. automatically adjusting the model hyperparameter based on the environment without any manual involvement/interventions)
6. continuous improvement by learning new patterns and using them in next iterations.
